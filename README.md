A cool plugin to troll players during "100 players events" Videos

It has some features like :

- Enabling/Disabling PvP
- Alert players that they will be mooved on a discord channel
- Make them explode
- Launch them in the air, give them bonus, change their max-health, change their armor, clear stuff, throw fireball, every other effect on the "random spin"
- Play screamer sound (creeper sound, zombies, ender dragon, ect...
- surround them with water
- And a lot of other effects that I forgot because I made this long ago
